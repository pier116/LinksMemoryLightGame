Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One of the largest challenges I faced during this project was with syntax. I've only ever coded in C++, Java, and Python, so coming into this project, I had no prior experience to HTML, CSS, or Javascript. There was definitely a learning curve when it came to understanding how all 3 files worked togther. For example, one of my biggest problem areas was in making an image appear when clicking on the buttons. Before this part, I was able to implement each part of the code without explicitly understanding function calls within HTML for functions in JS worked, so it took a lot of contemplation and trial-and-error on my part. I had to sit down with the code for an hour or two and draw on a piece of notebook paper how each function worked and how it communicated between the 3 files.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

After working on this website, I am excited to find out how large websites are able to create seamless UI/UX experiences in the form of smooth animations, like in drop-down menus or simply hovering the mouse pointer over an object on the website. I would also like to know the theory behind how developers implement menus, and specifically, how they know when to add a section to the header of a website or create a drop-down menu that lists all potential objects, i.e., sarificing convenience for page clutter. Laslty, I would love to know how developers come up with ways to combine fonts, colors, and shapes to appeal to the eye.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Given more time, the first thing I would do is add chords or more interesting sounds to my buttons. It would even be nice to have a soft song in the background. Next, I would add a timer to the game so it makes the user feel as if they're trying to race against the clock before Ganon (the enemy) captures Zelda. I would include a progress bar somewhere on the page that makes the user feel pressured as the time progresses, adding pressure to the user while they have to memorize the given sequence.
